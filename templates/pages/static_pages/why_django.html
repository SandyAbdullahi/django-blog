        <p><span class="text-primary h2 font-weight-bold">|</span>So I chose to use Django v3.0 (The version doesn’t
            matter). Django is an open-source framework used to handle the back-end functionality of web-based
            applications using python. However, in my opinion, it was a joy to work with when developing front end UI/Ux
            using the template view system and the core architecture that is the Model View Controller. The framework
            has a simple syntax that was easy to follow and reference later when importing modules in between one
            another. Including static files such as Style sheets and JavaScript into specific templates was very simple
            and quick to implement. Meaning the rapid prototyping of small scale applications is very plausible.</p>

        <p>Applying CRUD features was very straight forward as Django already comes pre-built with a load of functions
            and models. For example, when handling User Authentication, a developer can easily import the built-in User
            creation form (for handling user registration). After which the developer can use the inbuilt user login,
            logout, password change views, to handle the rest of the User authentication functionality.</p>

        <p>Originally when starting with the documentation for Django, I took the TDD( Test Driven Development)
            approach. Where a developer would test for behaviors that haven’t been built yet, after which the developer
            would build those behaviors, in turn, passing those tests.</p>

        <p>For the development of my applications, I chose to follow a more BDD (Behavior Driven Development) approach,
            where the development of the applications followed the user stories more. I would build the features based
            on the functionality of the application and the necessary views and templates for the desired behavior of
            the app.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>In conclusion, I found Django to be an amazing and intuitive framework to implement. Writing view functions and porting new modules was a breeze. However, with the frameworks' abundance of modules and third-party packages. I fear that I have only just scratched the surface of Django's capabilities. On the other hand, it is a journey of discovery that I welcome greatly, my experience with Django has left me wanting to learn more about the framework and its features.</p>
