                <p>Ab Log is a project that I created to show off some of the beginner skills required for django app development. Ab Log contains all the basic <a href="https://stackify.com/what-are-crud-operations/"><span class="text-warning">CRUD</span></a> features that basic apps should have. The use case here is a simple blog where users can post along side static posts generated by the creator. The post can be in form of an article or a simple signature like a guest book.</p>
